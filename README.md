My Quantum Computing Journey :)
After reading Quantum Computing for the Very Curious by Michael Nielsen and Andy Matuschak, I became fascinated with quantum computation, especially its mathematical foundations. 
I explored 3Blue1Brown and IBM videos, as well as the 'Quantum Computing, TCAD and Semiconductor Devices' channel, which provides university lectures based on the book
"Introduction to Quantum Computing".
My A-level Physics preparation helped me develop intuition for quantum mechanics: I can derive Schrödinger’s equations and understand Dirac’s and Einstein’s contributions to electron
probability clouds, wave-particle duality, and related concepts. I’m not at a graduate level yet, but this foundation is solid enough to get started.
Gaps in linear algebra have limited my progress, but I’m eager to improve. For now, I plan to study Nielsen’s Quantum Computation and Quantum Information and work on mini-projects,
which I will share here on GitHub.
Follow along as I explore this mysterious and compelling field: the inspiration behind my pursuit of Computer Science and Mathematics.
